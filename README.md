# 🚗 Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) using YOLOv8, SORT, and OpenCV

This project is an end-to-end real-time Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system built using:

- **YOLOv8** for license plate detection
- **SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)** for tracking license plates across frames
- **OpenCV** for video handling, visualization, and image processing

---

## 📌 Features

- 📷 Real-time license plate detection from webcam or video file
- 🔁 Object tracking using SORT with unique IDs per license plate
- 🖼️ Cropping of license plates from video frames (OCR-ready)
- 💻 Simple Python-based implementation
- 🧱 Modular structure – easy to integrate OCR like Tesseract or EasyOCR
